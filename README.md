## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod is probably the biggest visual overhaul of the game since it was released. It reinstates the extended night areas that are missing from **all** main areas. Now, when you open doors at night they show light from inside the building. Buildings actually have windows that are lit up. 
Many night maps have their own lighting map and interiors are equipped with candles, torches and lights.<br>
As luck would have it, two met by chance in the Beamdog and Gibberlings 3 forums, respectively. The thanks here goes to Jastey. 
One was trying to deal with all the problems of the two versions not working properly for both engine variants. The other was just tweaking and beautifying the graphics further. 
Fortunately, when they finally got in contact, there was an incredible synergy effect. They understood each other right away and joined forces.
Not only were all the old graphics from IWD reworked, but they also decided to add all the areas from IWD1, IWD1 HoW, IWD1 TotLM, IWD2 without the original night map.
This means that there are now 71 new night maps. In total 152 maps will be improved.
These are the night maps and also day maps. Light maps are added, graphical bugs are fixed, animated water areas are added, over 7000 animated candles, torches and lights are added.
Especially with the animated candles, torches and lights, old maps can be improved at any time.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is compatible with both Infinity Engine variants. Only IWD1 is not compatible with night maps, because it is the bg1 engine.
Therefore, almost all Icewind Dale variants are compatible with this version. Primarily with IWD1 EET, IWD2 EE and IWDEE of course, but also with IWD2, IWD2 EE. IWD in bg2 has not been tested yet.<br>
This mod is compatible with all mods that do not overwrite are, wed, tis, pvrz and bmp files. are and wed files should be patched then. <br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-IWDGO.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **IWDGO** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Windows

To install, copy the files to the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file.
Simply double-click **`setup-IWDGO.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-IWDGO.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Icewind Dale Graphical Overhaul for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: IWDGO folder, setup-IWDGO and setup-IWDGO.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-IWDGO.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-IWDGO.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Icewind Dale Graphical Overhaul for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-IWDGO`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`or `IWD2.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-IWDGO --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="modding" id="intro"></a>Modding

The new version is very modular. This makes it not too difficult to add new content for areas.<br>
Is the area already included in the mod?<br>
Yes: Just add the new files to the appropriate folders under  :file_folder: IWDGO/base/... as well. <br>
No: Open the IWDGO.tp2 with a text editor and add the name of the area in the corresponding table ("iwd1_areas", "iwd1_how", "iwd1_totlm", "iwd2_areas"). Then the new files will be installed automatically. <br>
For the naming of the IWD1 areas the labeling of IWD1 EET is taken (ID1000), for IWD2 is IWD2 EET (IW1000), because the clarity of the area names is easier.<br><br>
For example, if we want to add new candles to an interior map:<br>
Create in the  :file_folder: IWDGO/base/are_patch/... a file with the name IWXXXX_are.tpa where IWXXXX is the name of the area.<br> Copy the code <br>
<sub><code>PATCH_DEFINE_ARRAY x_coord BEGIN 1235 235 785 END
PATCH_DEFINE_ARRAY y_coord BEGIN  847 333 753 END
PATCH_PHP_EACH x_coord AS index => x BEGIN
	LPM ~DELETE_EXISTING_ANIMATIONS~
	LPF fj_are_structure
	INT_VAR
		fj_loc_x = $x_coord("%index%")
		fj_loc_y = $y_coord("%index%")
		fj_schedule = 0b111111111111111111111111 //Hours All
		fj_flags = 0b00000000000000000001000001000011	// Visible, blend colours, not covered by wall, don't remove in combat
		STR_VAR
		fj_structure_type = animation
		fj_name = FLAME2S
		fj_bam_resref = FLAME2S
	END
END
LPM ~CLEAR_ARRAY~</code></sub> <br>
and add the correct coordinates. Now you have to check if the map appears in the lists of IWDGO.tp2. If not, you have to add the map to the list. Have a look at the examples in the existing files, there you can see different variants. <br>

Compatibility with other mods is also taken care of. For this you can use the above mentioned IWXXXX_are.tpa or also the IWXXXX_wed.tpa in the  :file_folder: IWDGO/base/wed_patch/... directory. Depending on what the compatibility requires, you can choose the appropriate files.
Example:<br>
TDDz: Here the are files must be patched. So we use for example the ID1000_are.tpa.<br>
GavinNPC: Here a door must be added to the wed file, so we use the BG3300_wed.tpa.<br>

Also with the searchmap you can prevent overwriting the files by using the SRmap_modding_tool. The IWXXXXSR.2da file created with this tool is always preferred to the corresponding IWXXXXSR.bmp. So only the changed pixels are added to the bmp file.
